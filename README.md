## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This project works in two main stages:

1.  **Data Fetching**: Python scripts in the `/scripts` directory are run to scrape post information (like titles, images, and links) from various websites. The collected data is then saved into `.json` files within the `/data` directory.
2.  **Static Site Generation**: The `index.html` file in the `/docs` directory uses JavaScript to read the `.json` data files. It then dynamically generates a grid or list of all the posts, creating a browsable gallery. This means the website content is always as fresh as the last data fetch.

This process can be automated using GitHub Actions to run the scripts on a schedule, ensuring the gallery is always up-to-date.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need Python 3. Follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[Your-GitHub-Username]/[Your-Repo-Name].git
    cd [Your-Repo-Name]
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage

To fetch the latest posts, run the main Python script:

```bash
# This will update the JSON files in the /data directory
bash start.sh
